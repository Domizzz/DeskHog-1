# Printing

`DeskHog-all_parts.3mf` contains everything you need to print your own DeskHog. All parts are at their intended printing orientations.

DeskHog prints have been tested with PETG on Bambu printers. For best results, stick with translucent PETG. The tool-free, friction-fit assembly requires dialed-in dimensional accuracy (Bambu worked fine out of the box, others may require some tuning). If the pieces are a little snug, a modeling file or sandpaper across the tabs on the bezel can probably get you on your way.
