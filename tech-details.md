# DeskHog technical details

Microcontrollers are a pain. They've got limited memory and, for our purposes here, you've got to write C++ ðŸ« 

But in exchange, our code can touch reality like no other kind of project. Here's what we're dealing with.

### Core and task isolation

If you've ever written mobile code, you'll feel right at home: we can only update the UI via the UI thread, otherwise the board crashes.

We've got two cores and multiple "tasks" assigned between them â€“ task is [FreeRTOS](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/ESP32/examples/FreeRTOS/BasicMultiThreading)-speak for threads:

**Core 0 (Protocol CPU) tasks:**

- WiFi
- Web portal server
- Insight parsing
- NeoPixel control

**Core 1 (Application CPU) tasks:**

- LVGL tick (maintains timing, animations, etc for the graphics library) 
- UI: screen drawing and input handling

We have to keep this stuff carefully isolated or we're going to crash.

### Buttons

If the board isn't responding:

- Hold **â–¼ (Page down/D0)**
- Press **Reset**
- Release **â–¼ (Page down/D0)**

The board will restart in bootloader mode, where it can be re-flashed using PlatformIO.

### Pin definitions

You don't have to guess the pin definitions. You'll find them documented here:

~/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoespressif32/variants/adafruit_feather_esp32s3_reversetft/pins_arduino.h

## UI progress

- Status card: working
- WiFi provisioning card with QR Code: working
- Friend card to give you (mild) reassurance: working
- Numeric card for Big Number insights: working
- Funnel card: needs a redesign; probably should be horizontal layout instead, won't display more than three steps right now
- Line graph card: working decently, but could use more detail
- Other insights: not yet supported

## Important components

### Event queue

`EventQueue` is how the project manages communication between tasks and prevents coupling. Events â€“ changes via the web UI, returned requests from the PostHog client â€“ are dispatched out of core 0 to be received by the UI task. Any important data can be safely copied from one context into the other, preventing crashes and other drama.

### Card stack

The UI is a stack of cards. The user navigates between them using built-in buttons (the arrow keys)

`CardNavigationStack` manages the UI presentation of these cards, animating transitions.

`CardController` manages updates to the stack contents. If an insight is deleted or added via web UI, the controller processes that update reactively.

### Web UI

A basic provisioning and configuration UI is provided. You can access it via a QR code on first launch, and by the IP shown in the status screen once WiFi is configured.

Open `html/portal.html` in your browser to preview changes. The contents of `html` are inlined into a single file on each build by `htmlconvert.py`.

**Web portal budget:** Right now the portal costs about 18KB. We'll allow up to **100KB**. All portal assets must be locally available, since the portal needs to work when the device doesn't have WiFi. If you want to try adding a more complex UI framework than hand-rolled JS and HTML, you're welcome to try as long as its build system is quick and the final static output is under 100KB.

### Card system

The DeskHog uses a dynamic card system that allows users to configure which cards appear on their device through a web UI. Cards are managed by the `CardController` and can be easily extended by developers.

#### Built-in cards

`ProvisioningCard` displays a QR code to connect to the device. If WiFi is connected, it displays connection stats.

`InsightCard` visualizes PostHog data. Numeric card is working best. The rest need help.

`FriendCard` lets Max the hedgehog visit with you and provide encouragement.

#### Adding new card types

To create a new card type, you need to:

1. **Add to CardType enum** - Add your new type to the `CardType` enum in `src/ui/CardController.h`
2. **Create the card class** - Implement your card UI using LVGL
3. **Register the card type** - Add it to CardController's registration system
4. **Add configuration support** (optional) - If your card needs user input

**Example: Adding a simple "Hello World" card**

```cpp
// 1. Add to CardType enum (src/ui/CardController.h)
enum class CardType {
    INSIGHT = 0,
    FRIEND = 1,
    HELLO = 2  // Add your new type here
};

// 2. Create your card class (src/ui/HelloCard.h)
class HelloCard {
public:
    HelloCard(lv_obj_t* parent);
    lv_obj_t* getCard() const { return _card; }

private:
    lv_obj_t* _card;
};

// 3. Register in CardController::initializeCardTypes()
CardDefinition helloDef;
helloDef.type = CardType::HELLO;
helloDef.name = "Hello world";
helloDef.allowMultiple = true;
helloDef.needsConfigInput = false;
helloDef.uiDescription = "A simple greeting card";
helloDef.factory = [this](const String& configValue) -> lv_obj_t* {
    HelloCard* newCard = new HelloCard(screen);
    return newCard ? newCard->getCard() : nullptr;
};
registerCardType(helloDef);
```

**Card definition properties:**
- `type`: Unique enum value for your card type
- `name`: Display name in the web UI
- `allowMultiple`: Whether users can add multiple instances
- `needsConfigInput`: Whether the card requires configuration input
- `configInputLabel`: Label for the config input field (if needed)
- `uiDescription`: Description shown in the web UI
- `factory`: Lambda function that creates card instances

#### Web UI integration

The web UI automatically displays available card types with:
- Add buttons for cards that can be added
- Configuration inputs for cards that need them
- Status indicators showing how many instances are configured
- Drag-and-drop reordering for configured cards

No web UI changes are needed when adding new card types - everything is driven by the card registration system.

### Insight parser and PostHog client

`InsightParser` ingests PostHog API responses and makes them available to the UI. `PostHogClient` constructs requests and dispatches responses.

### LVGL

This project relies on the powerful [LVGL project](https://docs.lvgl.io/9.2/intro/index.html) at [v9.2.2](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/lvgl/lvgl?version=9.2.2) for drawing, animation and other UI tasks.

### Config manager and captive portal

`ConfigManager` handles persistent storage and retrieval of credentials and insights. `CaptivePortal` provides the web server and interacts with `ConfigManager` to read and write to persistent storage.

### PNG sprite system

The project includes a `png2c.py` script that automatically converts PNG images into LVGL-compatible C arrays. This makes it easy to add sprite-based animations and graphics to DeskHog. The script runs before each build, so your sprites are always up to date. Beware: the board has limited storage and we already use most of it. Optimize your images aggressively and use PNG files sparingly.

#### How it works

1. **Place PNG files in subdirectories** under `raw-png/`:
   ```
   raw-png/
   â”œâ”€â”€ walking/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frame_01.png
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frame_02.png
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ frame_03.png
   â”œâ”€â”€ idle/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ idle_01.png
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ idle_02.png
   â””â”€â”€ attack/
       â””â”€â”€ attack_01.png
   ```

2. **Run the conversion script**:
   ```bash
   python3 png2c.py
   ```

3. **Generated output**:
   - Individual header/source files for each sprite in `include/sprites/`
   - Filenames are preserved (e.g., `frame_01.png` â†’ `sprite_frame_01.h/c`)
   - A master `sprites.h` and `sprites.c` containing arrays for each subdirectory

#### Using sprites in your code

```cpp
#include "sprites/sprites.h"

// Access the walking animation array
lv_obj_t* img = lv_img_create(parent);
lv_img_set_src(img, &walking_sprites[0]);  // First frame

// Animate through frames
for (int i = 0; i < walking_sprites_count; i++) {
    lv_img_set_src(img, walking_sprites[i]);
    // Add delay or use LVGL animation
}
```

#### Features

- **Automatic grouping**: Each subdirectory gets its own array (e.g., `walking_sprites[]`, `idle_sprites[]`)
- **Count variables**: Each array has a corresponding count (e.g., `walking_sprites_count`)
- **LVGL compatible**: Generates ARGB8888 format data structures that work directly with LVGL 9.x

#### Requirements

- Python 3
- Pillow and numpy (required):
  ```bash
  pip install Pillow numpy
  ```
